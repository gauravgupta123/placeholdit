# Placeholdit jQuery Plugin

Automatically replaces IMG tags on a page with placeholder images from http://placehold.it. It can be an invaluable tool for designers while they are planning a new web page layout.

# Example:

Just add the following one line of code to your webpage. The jQuery javascript library is required on that page.

    $('body').placeholdit();
